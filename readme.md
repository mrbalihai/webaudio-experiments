# WebAudio Experiments

[https://mrbalihai.github.io/webaudio-experiments](Live Demo)

## Resources
- Drum synthesis examples used from here [https://sonoport.github.io/synthesising-sounds-webaudio.html](https://sonoport.github.io/synthesising-sounds-webaudio.html)
- [Mozilla MDN: Web Audio API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API)

## About
This repo is just my tinkerings with the WebAudioAPi as a means to learn more about digital audio and a bit of a creative coding exercise. The code is quite rough and hacky.

The 'j', 'k' and 'l' keys are mapped to different drums. The visualisation is done using the WebAudio Analyser with ThreeJS. You can fly around the visualisation with 'w', 'a', 's' and 'd'.

Eventually I want to go on to create a sequencer that can record samples and apply filters.

## Getting Started
An index.html is included that loads the script using browser native module loading.

```
npm install && npm start
```
